I am an expert C++ developer and I need your help to fix issues in this code that were identified by the Infer static analyzer.

Below is the source code with potential bugs:

```cpp
{{SOURCE_CODE}}
```

The static analyzer found the following issues:
{{ERROR_INFO}}

Each issue includes:
- The issue type and location
- A description of the problem
- Code context around the issue
- Possible causes and implications
- Suggestions for fixing the issue

Test results (if available):
{{TEST_RESULTS}}

Please provide a corrected version of the code that fixes all the identified issues. Your solution should:
1. Address all the root causes, not just symptoms
2. Follow C++ best practices
3. Be minimal and focused on fixing the specific issues identified
4. Maintain the original code functionality

For each fix, please briefly explain what the issue was and how your changes address it.
