You are an expert C++ programmer tasked with fixing code errors according to Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles and static analysis results.

## SOURCE CODE
{{SOURCE_CODE}}

## STATIC ANALYSIS RESULTS (INFER)
{{ERROR_INFO}}

## FAILED TEST CASES
{{TEST_RESULTS}}

Your task is to implement corrections that:
1. Make all tests pass according to TDD methodology
2. Fix all static analysis issues reported by Infer
3. Maintain the original code structure and naming conventions
4. Consider edge cases and error handling

Follow this process:
1. First analyze the failing tests to understand the expected behavior
2. Review the Infer static analysis issues (memory leaks, null pointers, uninitialized values, etc.)
3. Make minimal changes required to fix both test failures and static analysis warnings
4. Ensure your solution handles edge cases properly
5. Add appropriate error handling where necessary

When fixing memory issues:
- Prefer RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) patterns
- Use smart pointers (std::unique_ptr, std::shared_ptr) when appropriate
- Ensure proper resource cleanup in all code paths

Format your response as follows:
```cpp
// Your corrected code here
```

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the corrected code with minimal brief comments explaining each fix. Focus on producing correct, robust code rather than explanations.
