I am an expert C++ developer and I need your help to fix issues in this code that were identified by the static analyzer.

Below is the source code with potential bugs:

```cpp
{{SOURCE_CODE}}
```

The static analyzer found the following issues:
{{ERROR_INFO}}

Test results (if available):
{{TEST_RESULTS}}

Please provide a corrected version of the code that fixes all the identified issues. Your solution should:
1. Address the root causes, not just symptoms
2. Follow C++ best practices
3. Be minimal and focused on fixing the specific issues identified
4. Maintain the original code functionality

For each fix, please briefly explain what the issue was and how your changes address it.
